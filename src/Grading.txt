Good work!

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the set of
methods that did the individual lines within the verses.

You have some good structure and efficiency, but you're not quite
consistent with it.  You use MaltJack() at the end of RatThree(),
which is excellent.  You use it at the end of CatFour() as well,
which is good, though it would have been even better if you had used
RatThree() at the end of CatFour() instead, and you would have been able to
get rid of one additional line.  Still, that was really good.  But for
DogFive(), you didn't stick with that structure of calling the
previous methods, but instead listed out all the lines.  If you had
made DogFive() print its line then call into CatFour(), for example,
that would have removed quite a few redundant println commands.  No
points off for that, though.  You did a good job of building structure
and efficiency.


You have quite a few repeated println statements.  If you needed
to change the wording, for instance, you would have to change it
in quite a few different places.  If you put those statements into
methods and call them, as you did with the Jack() method, the
program would be more efficient to maintain.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call Ate(), you call Lay() immediately afterwards.
Therefore, you could add Lay() at the end of your Ate() method, and
remove it from the verse methods.  Then, you could do the same thing
with Killed (add Ate() at the end of it), etc.  Your Maiden() function,
then, would have just your first printed line, and the Milked()
method, and everything else would happen automatically.
